# Face Recognition System

This repository was prepared for my university graduation project. This project was awarded support under the 2023 second-term 2209-A Üniversite Öğrencileri Araştırma Projeleri Destekleme Programı.

Nowadays, deep learning models and artificial intelligence technologies have made significant progress in the field of facial recognition, achieving high accuracy levels. In this context, they hold 
great potential for future security systems. In this project, a versatile facial recognition system has been developed using deep learning models. The project aims to make personnel attendance control
more effective while also facilitating institutional security monitoring processes. The facial recognition system can be controlled through both mobile and desktop applications. Additionally, 
since basic operations are carried out via a web service, it is quite easy to integrate it into different systems.

The project includes object detection with YOLO, face region detection with MTCNN, and face recognition using FaceNet. The main structure of the project is built on an API system, 
utilizing Flask for the API. There are two applications for the project: a desktop application and a mobile application. You can access the desktop application through this repository.
